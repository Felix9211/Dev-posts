#How Analysts Translate Messy Data, DAX, and Dashboards into Action Using Power BI.
####Introduction
We are living in a world where data is widespread amongst us. The data is thus represented for easier visualization and interpretation by the masses. This entails either organizations or institutions and thereby Microsoft power bi comes handy in ensuring `data cleaning` is done on raw messy data and transformed into detailed and clean visual representations on dashboards.

#### Data Cleaning
The widespread data is normally on its raw form and messy hence the need of tools that help with cleaning it making it easily visualized and represented. Basically that's what we call data cleaning and through Power Bi it is easily achieved through analyzing the data set of interest

### Power BI
#### Power Query
Under the Power Bi tool, with the help of power query editor, data is cleaned up and shaped to meet the user need. What the Power Query editor does is connect and shape data sources then loading it back to the Power Bi for analysis.

#### Data Analysis Expression (DAX)
After the data structuring, with the help of **DAX**
> Which is a formula expression type of language that helps in the arithmetical or rather perfoming the relevant calculations in the data set hence turning raw data into Insights.

This formula set has all the complex and simplistic calculation sets

After the whole compilation of the data cleanup and analysis, The Power Bi tool cast the analysis on a visual dashboard whereby its represented through various visualization models.
